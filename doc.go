// package b2
// is a client library for Backblaze B2.
//
// This library was written to support
// b2proxy, but you can use it independently
// if you'd like.
//
// Since this library supports a specific
// application, it does not wrap the
// complete set of B2 APIs.
// Over time we may add support for more
// B2 APIs, but it is not the intention
// of this library to support the
// 'kitchen sink' of B2 functionality.
// Instead, we'd like to keep the library
// surface-area small, and try to paper over
// as many B2 API idiosyncracies as we
// reasonably can.
